The aim of this project is to create an accurate basketball prediction model that can serve to automate stat-taking in team sports.

DATASET CREATION: 
The data for the model is being manually processed at the moment. The 'clip_generator' file serves to convert annotated timestamps to 6 second clips to feed to the model.
The other alternative involves using computer vision and the NBA play by play data to skipped to the timestamps provided and automatically generate the clips.

The first goal is to create enough data to feed to a model, and see what kind of accuracy we can get.
